## Chapter 4: Mixing Up "Class" Objects
### Lessons
+ Inheritance/Class Instantiation is a **copy operation of functionality** from parent to child class or from class to object instance. After this  operation, there is no link between the class and object or parent and child class. A class is just a blueprint. After Instantiation, you get a data structure.


+ JS has **NO CLASSES!** only **OBJECTS**. And hence no copy operations from one object to another as in classes but behaviour delegation.

+ Explicit mixins are  not exactly like class copy operations since objects and functions only have the shared references duplicated not the objects themselves.
